_Two important points about your Work With Me document:_

1. It's your document—this is just a starting point to help you in beginning to write it. Feel free to add and
remove sections. Feel free to start with an empty page and fill it out however you'd like.
1. It's meant to be a change with you—update it as frequently (or infrequently) as you'd like.

_You might want to [estimate the reading time](http://niram.org/read/) of your document and keep it to 5 minutes or less._

## Values
I value humility, kindness, compassion, accountability.

## Personality
I am friendly and open but am somewhat introverted by nature. 

## Receiving Feedback & Recognition
I am ok with recognition in any format! I can handle constructive negative feedback, I prefer getting it in the mnost explicit and direct way rather than someone pulling their punches or being opaque.

## Work Patterns
I keep typical work hours. If I work outside of conventional 9-5 I will do it in the evening.

I don't have preferences about when I work alone versus groups. 
## Communication Preferences

Slack during and outside of work hours. If it's an emergency and I don't respond to Slack, call or text.  If I am offline on Slack then I am not working. I will still typically read messages when notified.

## Career Goals & Future Interests
One of the reasons I left management was continue working on my technical skills. I took this job to get back to being a full time automation engineer. 

## Areas for Development
I have difficulty retaining verbal information. I am a borderline pathological note taker. I may ask your permission to record something if it is long and complex but I don't want to interupt the flow with asking you to slow down so I can take notes. 

## Ask Me About
Record collecting, houseplants
