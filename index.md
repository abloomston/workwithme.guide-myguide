## Values

  - I think life is boring without a problem or task that is a **Challenge**. Challenges rewarding to tackle and solve.  
  - That yields a **Learning** experience which helps me **Grow**. 
  - With that said, I do need time and space for a work-life **Balance**.  I take time for myself daily to unwind and prepare myself for the next challenge to come.
  - I value **humility** and **candor** from others.

## Personality

  - **Reflecting**: I often times think about one topic for extensive periods of time. An easy way to spot if I'm reflecting is when I mention a conversation topic from 5 minutes ago (or 5 days ago) when the conversation has progressed elsewhere. Here are some things I might reflect upon:
    - Think about a problem, challenge, or conjecture e.g. "The Clinton Conjecture: [Robert Delaunay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Delaunay) and [Boris Delaunay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boris_Delaunay) are related."
    - Reflect on a conversation topic, e.g. "Which do you prefer, Roman columns or Greek pillars?"
    - Or ideals, dreams, and counterexamples, e.g. "One day `x = y/z;` will be constant time."

### Warning Signs

**When you don't feel safe in a conversation, how does this manifest itself in your actions or affects?**

  - I can be fairly reserved until I feel comfortable.  Here comfort can mean any of the following:
    1. I know and am at ease with the individuals I am with;
    1. The stated problem is clear enough and I have enough knowledge to provide feedback. Try asking me questions to help spur my feedback and comfort.
  - If I'm uncomfortable, I'll stay quiet and I will become less of a participant in conversation.
  - **Conflict**: I sometimes avoid conflict which does not resolve the problem.  Providing feedback helps.
  - **Rumination**:  I am _always_ my biggest critic.  Just tell me to relax.  It was the best advice I got from teammates when I played college hockey.

## Receiving Feedback & Recognition

**How do you best receive feedback, be it positive or negative?**

  - Positive feedback: private slack channel feedback is awesome!  Should your heart want to call it out at orientation meetings, go for it.
  - Negative feedback: 1-1s are best and private slack channel. Provide an example of my actions or character.  That can help me learn.

## Work Patterns

**What hours do you usually work?**

  - I usually go to the gym before work and I am usually in the office by 10:30am PST.
  	- I am flexible to come into the office (or zoom in) earlier to meet with you 
      - Please ask ahead of time!  If it's late the day before you want an early morning meeting, slack or text me about it just to be sure I'm aware of it.
  - Meetings are ideal 11am-3pm, the sooner the better. 

**When do you prefer to work alone, versus in groups?**

  - **Meetings**: Ideally, I like it when meetings have an agenda _with_ an expected outcome/decision, e.g. "Project Fox is slated for the next sprint.  Will we use firestore or mongodb for the nosql?"
  - **Learning**: For learning about a particular thing, area of focus, or problem, I prefer to work alone and then share my findings at planning stage.  I will reach out to others to get ideas or when I have a question.
  - **Planning**: I prefer planning as a group; especially so when designing a new "thing".
  - **Development**: I like to code solo for the most part.  I will call upon help when I'm having a hard time debugging, or need a second pair of eyes when writing something.
  - **Testing/Integration**: So not so much as a group but I will definitely seek advice and feedback for validation.

**How do your energy levels fluctuate throughout the day?**

  - Around 3:30 or so, my energy levels can drop and I may take a break for a snack or tea.  If its a heavy lift day, sometimes I can get loopy in the morning and my mind and body are still recovering.
  - If I've been in flow for a considerable part of the working day, my brain will kind of just stop in the very late afternoons.  At that point it becomes a grind.

## Communication Preferences

**What should people expect from you when they reach out to you on Email or Slack?**

  - If you want me to respond, then message me on slack!
  - On average, I receive about 104 emails per business day.  So how about that slack?

**How should people best get your attention for urgent matters outside of normal working hours?**

  - Slack me first.
  - If you still need a response, then texting me is your best bet.

**What's your relationship to work communication when not at work?**

  - I'll do what I can to respond upon availability.

**What are your signs that you'd prefer to not be interrupted when at work?**
  
  - For remotes:  I don't update my slack status regularly.  If I don't want to be disturbed I'll manually set Slack to do not disturb.

## How To Know I'm in Flow

  - For those in SF: (1) A cup of tea is on my desk, (2) Sublime, Terminal, or a dark theme web page is open on my screen, and (3) I have ear buds in my ears or cans on my head.
  - For remotes: I'll try to activate the do not disturb button on slack.

## Areas for Development

  - Asking questions that strike at the heart of the issue.  Sometimes I don't know what questions to ask to get a better understanding of context.
  - I am notorious of over complicating designs.  If I show you something that looks complicated, as a rule of thumb, call that out.
  - I hope to learn more about [art based research](http://elevr.com/portfolio/art-based-research/) and incorporate this into my professional development.

## Ask Me About

  - Linear programming, optimization, and math.
  - Cryptography (the symmetric kind)
  - GPS
  - Software bugs and bug hunting: CVEs, fuzzing, symbolic execution, and reverse engineering tools
  - Ice hockey, power lifting, and hiking
