## Values

* I value **curiosity** and **self-reliance**. I love digging into new problem areas or technologies and figuring those out on my own.
* I value **passion** and **cooperation**. Pairing with a colleague on a problem they are as interested in solving as I am is awesome.
* I aspire to be **consistent** from both a technical standpoint and how I approch relationships with my colleagues.
* I often fill the role of _facilitator_. I strive to make sure the people around me feel **heard** and **understood**.

## Personality

* I tend to avoid interpersonal conflict but often pursue the conflict that comes out of discussing technical or process problems. I relish a good back and forth on a technical or process related issue. It is an interesting dichotomy that I am still trying to figure out.
* I see myself as an **optimist**. It takes a lot to make me sad or angry or annoyed.
* I aspire to be **playful**. This is an important part of interactions with my colleagues. I like to to joke and have fun in meetings, this sometimes can lead to me getting _off-topic_.
* I am very **confident**. I tend to speak with authority even when I am not a subject matter expert on the topic of conversation. I am working on this.

* My Meyers-Biggs type is INFP-A.

## Receiving Feedback & Recognition

* I have taken the test and my love language is **quality-time**. This rings true to me. Having conversations where the other person is listening and engaged is very important to me.

* I welcome critical or negative feedback but I ask that it is given in a private 1 on 1.

* I find it difficult to give critical or negative feedback to others. This is the part of me that avoids interpersonal conflict. I am working on this.

## Work Patterns
I live and work remotely in Denver, CO where the timezone is UTC-7 (UTC-6 during daylight savings). I'll talk here using the timezone of San Francisco, UTC-8 (UTC-7 during daylight savings), as this where most of my colleagues live and work.

#### What hours do you usually work?

* I typically get up at around 5am and go to the gym in mornings.
* I start working around 7am and stop working between 4:30pm and 5pm.
* I really value work life balance and make it a point to not work on the weekends unless explicitly asked to.

#### When do you prefer to work alone, versus in groups?
* I prefer pair programming or 1 on 1s after lunch.
* I like to work things out on my own before reaching out for help.

#### How do your energy levels fluctuate throughout the day?
* In general I find that I have a lot of energy throughout the the day.
* I feel most productive in the morning right when I sit down to work.
* After lunch I generally get a little groggy for an hour or so.

## Communication Preferences
* I prefer Slack for getting my attention. I have a personal target of responding to slack messages within 5 minutes during my working hours (7am-5pm).
* If we need to talk at length about something I prefer face to face video calls using Meet or Zoom.
* I only check my email once a day in the mornings.
* Outside of my working hours I do not have a target for responding to work related communication. I do typically check Slack once during the evenings on weekdays and once or twice a day on weekends.
* When I am in the office and I have my headphones on I would prefer that you ping me on Slack before tapping on my shoulder.

## How To Know I’ve Gone To The Dark Side

#### Warning Signs
If I am dismissive or short in a conversation it is a sign that I might in a bad place.

#### How to help
Generally I  need space to calm down. I do appreciate when people reach out to see how I am doing and listen when I tell them how I am doing.

## Me Being Me
I often ask clarifying questions. I am genuinely curious about the topics of conversation that I engage in. This can seem like I am confronting or interrogating you though. This is not my intention and I working on how to more thoughtfully exercise my curiosity.

## Pet Peeves
_I don't expect this list to change your actions—but it might help you better understand and empathize with my reactions._
* Negativity. I don't see a lot of value in being negative. Its better to approach a hard situation from the perspective of what you can to do make it better rather that pointing out its flaws.
* Not using good microphones in meetings. As a remote employee this is super important to me. I need to be able to hear you to be able to have a conversation with you.

## Career Goals & Future Interests
* Short term: Continue to support and implement new features for the business intelligence platform at Pantheon. I've put a lot of time and energy into this and want it to reach its potential.
* Long term: Move into a role where I can have a higher level decision making capacity around the direction of technology in a business while supporting those around me. This means a management track in the near term and eventually a Director or VP role in the long term.

## Areas for Development
* I tend to get off topic in meetings. This comes from my desire to bring playfulness to work. This can get frustrating for those around me though. If I've overstepped and steered the conversation too far off track please tell me. I won't offend.
* I want to get better at giving critical feedback. I tend to avoid giving this feedback to my peers because it makes me uncomfortable. This is the part of me that avoids interpersonal conflict.
* I am very passionate about what I do. Sometimes to a fault. I need to get better about reining this in.

## Ask Me About
* Ski-mountaineering. I love to climb mountains and ski down them. It's one of the reasons I moved to Colorado.
* Brewing beer. I do this once every ~3 months or so and really enjoy the process and the finished product.
* I'm half Swedish and will wax poetic about my time in Sweden.
* My Dog Ollie. He's very adorable.
