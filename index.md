## My Tenets/Values
  - Be honest: Without this there cannot be trust and vulnerability and that's what I need/want to build connections with people
  - Have clear/direct communication: Life is too short for me to figure out what people are trying to say indirectly. Usually leads to miscommunication because I did not pick up on passive cues
  - Financial stability: This means I am pretty frugal (usually bringing my lunch) and very ambitious (have a side hustle or two) in my desire to be financially secure
  - Be a child @ heart: Though I am a full grown adult (I have proof!), I look for opportunities to have fun when I can
  - Be genuine: I say what I mean and mean what I say and I try to bring my full self to work and encourage others to do the same.

## Work Patterns
- I tend to be in the office 10am to 4pm EST
- I am usually online/responsive before 10am and after 4pm or over the weekends
- I sometimes work strange hours when the mood/energy hits so don't be surprised if you see weekend/midnight commits
- I prefer to learn and develop on my own but will reach out once I have a clearer idea of something I want to ask
- My energy fluctuates depending on activities/interactions and on days/weeks I see heavy people interaction I try to adjust my schedule accordingly.
- I am an introvert so I need alone time to recharge

## Communication Preferences
Slack is my preference and I tend to not respond to messages immediately so feel free to ping again if not responded to in an hour. If Slack is snoozed, please only send notifications if urgent. I try to respond to email within 24 hours. If there is an action associated with the email though, I might not respond until I completed the action so helpful to give me a deadline with an email so I know how to prioritize it.

## Areas of Development
- PHP
- Tensorflow/Machine Learning
- Android Development
- React

## Receiving Feedback & Recognition
Provide recognition however you see fit in private or in public or via Slack. I am pretty indifferent by it. Please provide criticism in a private setting and with concrete examples and be as to the point as possible.

## Warning Signs
I might be low energy or mention that I did not get enough sleep (I don't ingest caffeine in anyway) or I am hungry (I have an active appetite) or I have a packed schedule or have been pretty busy and haven't had a moment of peace yet.

### How to Help
Give me time to catch my breath and catch up.
Suggest we do something active that can help with my energy like going for a walk.
Encourage a snack and come back to the topic later.
