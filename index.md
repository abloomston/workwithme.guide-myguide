_Two important points about your Work With Me document:_

1. It's your document—this is just a starting point to help you in beginning to write it. Feel free to add and
remove sections. Feel free to start with an empty page and fill it out however you'd like.
1. It's meant to be a change with you—update it as frequently (or infrequently) as you'd like.

you feel most comfortable receiving that recognition?
