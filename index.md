## Values

- Transparency: Keep it open and keep it real.  
- Empathy: I try to understand who I am talking to, and I'm willing to talk/listen/learn about any situation - good or bad
- Knowledge: My desire to learn is strong - I like to know all-the-things
- Teaching/Mentorship:  Helping others succeed can be just as rewarding for me as solving things myself

## Personality

- Curious: I will likely keep an ear open to most things just because I can
- Commanding: Not because I must, but because I am willing to.  I will gladly let others drive a meeting, project, or scenario, but I am willing to pick up the torch if others are uncomfortable doing it.
- "Challenge Accepted": I like to live in the gray areas and unknowns.  It keeps life interesting.

## Receiving Feedback & Recognition

- I am always welcome to feedback as it helps me grow.
- Keep the feedback constructive.  "I don't like your hair" isn't really helpful.
- Communication channels: Private slack messages and 1:1s are the most welcome.  

## Work Patterns

- Start time: 7-9am ET.
- End Time: I would like to be done by 5pm ET.
- I have two younger school aged children that we are trying to help explore / enjoy the world with.

## Communication Preferences

- Slack is the best.
- I have a bad memory, so never feed bad about "pinging" me with a private message reminder if you are waiting on me for something


## Me Being Me

- I tend to ask a lot of questions. I'd rather ask a question and be the person who looks "dumb" the end up the [Too Afriad to Ask](https://imgflip.com/memetemplate/69723592/Chris-Pratt---Too-Afraid-to-Ask).
- Sometimes I ask overly broad questions - I do this on purpose to see where the conversation goes and to make sure I'm learning about the ["unknown unknowns"](https://theunknownunknown.org/what-are-unknown-unknowns/)
- Sometimes I get [nerd sniped](https://xkcd.com/356/). It's not difficult to get me excited about a subject, so don't feel bad about telling me to stay on-topic.
