_Two important points about your Work With Me document:_

1. It's your document—this is just a starting point to help you in beginning to write it. Feel free to add and
remove sections. Feel free to start with an empty page and fill it out however you'd like.
1. It's meant to be a change with you—update it as frequently (or infrequently) as you'd like.

_You might want to [estimate the reading time](http://niram.org/read/) of your document and keep it to 5 minutes or less._

## Values

  - I think life is boring without a problem or task that is find is a *Challenge*. It can be very rewarding to tackle and solve.  That yields a *Learning* experience which helps me *Grow*.
  - With that said, I do need time and space for a work-life *Balance*.  I take time for myself daily to unwind and prepare myself for the next challenge to come.

## Personality

  *How do you act in the world?*

  - *In Conversation*: My mind can stay on one topic even well after a conversation has progressed elsewhere. Sometimes I lose track of the conversation and just focus on that topic.

### Warning Signs

When you don't feel safe in a conversation, how does this manifest itself in your actions or affects?

  - I can be fairly reserved until I feel comfortable.  Here comfort can mean any of the following:
    1. I know and am at ease with the individuals I am with;
    1. The stated problem is clear enough and I have enough knowledge to provide feedback. Try asking me questions to help spur my feedback and comfort.
  - If I'm uncomfortable, I'll stay quiet and I will become less of a participant in conversation.

## Receiving Feedback & Recognition

How do you best receive feedback, be it positive or negative?

  - Positive feedback: private slack channel feedback is awesome!  Should your heart want to call it out at orientation meetings, go for it.
  - Negative feedback: 1-1s are best and private slack channel. Provide an example of my actions or character.  That can help me learn.

## Work Patterns

What hours do you usually work?

  - I usually go to the gym before work and I am usually in the office by 10:30am PST.
  	- I am flexible to come into the office (or zoom in) earlier to meet with you 
      - Please ask ahead of time!  If it's late the day before you want an early morning meeting, slack or txt me about it just to be sure I'm aware of it.
  - Meetings are ideal 11am-3pm, the sooner the better.  

When do you prefer to work alone, versus in groups? 

  - *Meetings*: Ideally, I like it when meetings have an agenda _with_ an expected outcome/decision, e.g. "Project Fox is slated for the next sprint.  Will we use firebase or mongodb for the nosql?"
  - *Learning*: For learning about a particular technology, area of focus, or problem, I prefer to work alone and then share my findings at planning stage.  I will reach out to others to get ideas or when I have a question.
  - *Planning*: I prefer planning as a group; especially so when designing a new "thing".
  - *Development*:  I like to code solo for the most part.  I will call upon help when I'm having a hard time debugging, or need a second pair of eyes when writing something.
  - *Testing/Integration*: So not so much as a group but I will definitely seek advice and feedback for validation.

How do your energy levels fluctuate throughout the day?

  Around 3:30 or so, my energy levels can drop and I may take a break for a snack or tea.  If its a heavy lift day, sometimes I can get loopy in the morning and my mind and body are still recovering.

## Communication Preferences

What should people expect from you when they reach out to you on Email or Slack?

  - Slack!

How should people best get your attention for urgent matters outside of normal working hours? 

  - Slack me first.
  - If you still need a response, then [texting me](https://getpantheon.bamboohr.com/employees/pto/?id=40624) is your best bet.

What's your relationship to work communication when not at work?

  - I'll do what I can to respond upon availability.

What are your signs that you'd prefer to not be interrupted when at work?
  
  - For remotes:  I don't update my slack status regularly.  If I don't want to be disturbed I'll manually set Slack to do not disturb.

## How To Know I'm in Flow

  - For those in SF: (1) A cup of tea is on my desk, (2) Sublime, Terminal, or Github is open on my screen, and (3) I have earbuds in my ears or cans on my head.
  - For remotes: I'll try to activate the do not disturb button on slack.

## Areas for Development

  - Asking questions that strike at the heart of the issue.
  - I am notorious of overcomplicating designs.  If I show you something that looks complicated, as a rule of thumb, call that out.

## Ask Me About

  - Linear programming, optimization, and math.
  - Cryptography
  - GPS
  - Software bugs and bug hunting: CVEs, fuzzing, symbolic execution, and reverse engineering tools.
  - Ice hockey, powerlifting, and hiking
