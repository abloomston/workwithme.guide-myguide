## Values
I value humility, kindness, compassion, accountability.

## Personality
I am friendly and open but am somewhat introverted by nature. 

## Receiving Feedback & Recognition
I am ok with recognition in any format! I can handle negative feedback as long as it's constructive. I prefer getting feedback in an explicit and direct way rather than someone pulling their punches or being opaque.

## Work Patterns
I keep typical work hours. If I work outside of conventional 9-5 I will do it in the evening. I don't have preferences about when I work alone versus groups. 

## Communication Preferences

Slack during and outside of work hours. If it's an emergency and I don't respond to Slack, call or text.  If I am offline on Slack then I am not working. I will still typically read messages when notified.

## Career Goals & Future Interests
One of the reasons I left management was continue working on my technical skills. I took this job to get back to being a full time automation engineer. 

## Areas for Development
I have difficulty retaining verbal information. I am a borderline pathological note taker. I may ask your permission to record something if it is long and complex but I don't want to interupt the flow with asking you to slow down so I can take notes. 

## Ask Me About
Record collecting, houseplants
