## Values

* I value **consistency**. For me, success is defined by the repeated ability to do something well.
* I value **work-life** balance
* **Optimism** and **persevence** are the driving forces in my life. Tough times are an eventuality and out of our hands, but dealing with them is what makes all the difference.
* **Exploration** and **learning** close out my top values as a constant state of mind.

## Personality

* I am **curious**. I love learning new things and am very easily interested in new things. I love getting into the nitty gritty and asking interesting questions! If you wish, always tell me more!

## Receiving Feedback & Recognition

How do you best receive feedback, be it positive or negative?

* I prefer to recieve feedback in private 1-1's (whether positive or negative) and love to ask more questions on how I can improve more and do better.

## Work Patterns

What hours do you usually work?

* I'm on Pacific Time and am usually start work around 9 a.m. PT and try to wrap up my work day around 5-6 pm to work out
* I might work in the evening as well, and might ping you but realize the imporatnce of having a work-life balance (as mentioned above) and respect your time. So no pressure to respond

When do you prefer to work alone, versus in groups?

* I love to plan things out **in a team** but prefer to learn by myself, where I can move at my own pace.
* I'm trying to get better at pairing up with others and making good use of pair-programming.

How do your energy levels fluctuate throughout the day?

* Unless sick, or otherwise stated, I'm pretty energetic throughout the day! 

## Communication Preferences

What should people expect from you when they reach out to you on Yammer, Email, or Slack?

* Between 9-5, unless in a meeting, I am usually able to respond to pings or emails within minutes. If not working, I'll be sure to get back to you within 12 hours of sending the message

* My preferred method for communication is **Slack** and I respond as quickly as possible to all pings


## How To Know I’ve Gone To The Dark Side

### Warning Signs


* I quiet down when I'm feeling out of it. Communicating my issues is something that I'm working on.

### How to help

* Just allowing me some time to step back and reflect usually helps. I'll get there, just need some time! 

## Me Being Me

* I constantly feel like I'm bothering people and make short work of apologizing for it. This changes as I settle down more and become more comdortable! (Won't take long based on how amazing and friendly Pantheors are)

## Pet Peeves

_I don't expect this list to change your actions—but it might help you better understand and empathize with my
reactions._

* Nothing special, be yourself! 

## Areas for Development

* Everything! Must keep getting better!

## Ask Me About

* Video games! I play a lot of games so if you're thinking of getting into something, want to play something together or just generally are interested in video games, let's chat! 
* Books: messages are always open for new book reccomendations!
