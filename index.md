## Values

  - I think life is boring without a problem or task that is a **Challenge**. Challenges are rewarding to tackle and solve.  
  - Challenges yield **Learning** experiences which help me **Grow**. 
  - With that said, I do need time and space for a work-life **Balance**.  I take time for myself daily to unwind and prepare myself for the next challenge to come.
  - I value **humility** and **candor** from others.
  - Lastly, what really can be exciting for me is seeing an _elegance_ in an engineered solution. 

## Personality

  - **Reflecting**: I often times think about one topic for extensive periods of time. An easy way to spot if I'm reflecting is when I mention a conversation topic from 5 minutes ago (or 5 days ago) when the conversation has progressed elsewhere. Here are some things I might reflect upon:
    - A problem, challenge, or conjecture, e.g. "The Clinton Conjecture: [Robert Delaunay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Delaunay) and [Boris Delaunay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boris_Delaunay) are related."
    - Reflect on a conversation topic, e.g. "Roman columns or Greek pillars? Discuss."
    - Ideals, dreams, and counterexamples, e.g. "One day `x = y/z;` will be constant time."

### Warning Signs

**When you don't feel safe in a conversation, how does this manifest itself in your actions or affects?**

  - I can be fairly reserved until I feel comfortable.  Here comfort can mean any of the following:
    1. I am familiar and at ease with the individuals I am with;
    1. The stated problem is clear enough and I have enough knowledge to provide feedback. Try asking me questions to spur my feedback and comfort.
  - If I'm uncomfortable, I'll stay quiet and I will become less of a participant in conversation.
  - **Conflict**: I sometimes avoid conflict which does not resolve the problem.  Providing feedback helps.
  - **Rumination**:  I am _always_ my biggest critic.  I set a pretty high bar for myself.  Just tell me to relax.  It was the best advice I got from teammates when I played college hockey.

## Receiving Feedback & Recognition

**How do you best receive feedback, be it positive or negative?**

  - Positive feedback: private slack channel feedback is awesome!  Should your heart want to call it out at orientation meetings, go for it.
  - Negative feedback: 1-1s are best and private slack channel. Provide an example of my actions or character.  That can help me learn.  

## Work Patterns

**What hours do you usually work?**

  - I usually go to the gym before work and I am usually in the office by 10:30am PST.
  	- I am flexible to come into the office (or zoom in) earlier to meet with you 
      - Please ask ahead of time!  If scheduling an early morning meeting the afternoon before, slack or text me about it just to be sure I'm aware of it.
  - Meetings are ideal 11am-3pm PST, the sooner the better.

**When do you prefer to work alone, versus in groups?**

  - **Meetings**: Ideally, I like it when meetings have an agenda _with_ an expected outcome/decision, e.g. "Project Fox is slated for the next sprint.  Will we use firestore or mongodb for the nosql?"
  - **Learning**: For learning about a particular thing, area of focus, or problem, I prefer to work alone and then share my findings at planning stage.  I will reach out to others to get ideas or when I have a question.
  - **Planning**: I prefer planning as a group; especially so when designing a new "thing".
  - **Development**: I like to code solo for the most part.  I will call upon help when I'm having a hard time debugging, or need a second pair of eyes when writing something.
  - **Testing/Integration**: So not so much as a group but I will definitely seek advice and feedback for validation.
  - **Retrospectives, EOLs, and Garbage Collection**: Let's do that together to reflect, respond, and learn. 

**How do your energy levels fluctuate throughout the day?**

  - Around 3:30 or so, my energy levels can drop and I may take a break for a snack or tea.  If its a heavy lift day, sometimes I can get loopy in the morning and my mind and body are still recovering.
  - If I've been in flow for a considerable part of the working day, my brain will kind of just stop in the very late afternoons.  At that point it becomes a grind.

## Communication Preferences

**What should people expect from you when they reach out to you on Email or Slack?**

  - If you want me to respond, then message me on slack!
  - On average, I receive about 104 emails per business day. There is a good chance I will miss your email, even when I know to look for it.
  - If you _must_ email me, let me know so I can create an email filter rule to forward it to my slack.  

**How should people best get your attention for urgent matters outside of normal working hours?**

  - Slack me first.
  - If you still need a response, then texting me is your best bet.

**What's your relationship to work communication when not at work?**

  - I'll do what I can to respond upon availability.

**What are your signs that you'd prefer to not be interrupted when at work?**
  
  - For remotes: I don't update my slack status regularly.  If I don't want to be disturbed I'll manually set Slack to do not disturb.

## How To Know I'm in Flow

  - For those in SF: (1) A cup of tea is on my desk, (2) Sublime, Terminal, or a dark theme web page is open on my screen, and (3) I have ear buds in my ears or cans on my head.
  - For remotes: I'll try to activate the do not disturb button on slack.

## Areas for Development

  - Asking questions that strike at the heart of the issue.  Sometimes I don't know what questions to ask to get a better understanding of context.
  - I am notorious for over complicating designs.  If I show you something that looks complicated, just call that out.
  - I hope to learn more about [art based research](https://github.com/clintonPantheon/workwithme.guide-myguide/blob/master/CritatCDG.pdf) and incorporate this into my professional development.
